    <i><p>A young <strong>python developer.</strong></p></i>
    <p>I'm a young adult who studied python ever since I have graduated highschool. I had a short experience developing a simple game with one of my friend who studied computer science and ever since I had the spark to learn it as well. I have built my programming experience by building small projects similar to this site as I learned the foundation through online books, courses and lectures. For now, as I'm going through new technologies I'm looking forward to work as a python developer.</p>
