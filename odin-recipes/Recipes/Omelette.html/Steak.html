        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
        <li><strong>Season generously</strong> – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
        <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
        <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
